1 . All the programs in this assignment are written in Python language. This includes the following programs:
Folder A: 
                  (a)AML_COURSEWORK _A _LOGISTIC
Use a logistic regression model for binary classification of task A.

                      (b) AML_COURSEWORK _A _CNN
             Use a convolutional neural network for binary classification of task A.

                         (c) AML_COURSEWORK _A _L1 _ITERATION _LEARNING
          Draw the learning curve with the number of iterations as a hyperparameter.

                           (d) AML_coursework _A _L1 _C LEARNING
                  Draw the learning curve with C as the hyperparameter.

Folder B: 
                          (a) AML_COURSEWORK _B
            Use a convolutional neural network for nine-class classification of task B.

                        (b) AML_B _EPOCHS LEARNING
                   Draw the learning curve with epochs as a parameter.

               (c) AML_COURSEWORK _B _NUMBER OF FILTERS LEARNING
              Draw the learning curve with the number of filters as a parameter.
